# VM_maker_robot_car
This is the code that was included with a light refactor.
Pay attention to where you are actually connecting the drive module as the code was wrong there. 
Either fix on the board or in the code.

My board had some issues too, but this is not related to the pdf that was shared from http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/presentations/robot-car-instructions.pdf

That is a different layout and the connections are different
